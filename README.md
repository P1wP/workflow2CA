## Practical
### For this practical exercise you will be required to automate the assignment that you created for your HTML and CSS course in first year. You may use one of Grunt, Gulp or Webpack for the process. You may use Sass or Less.

* Please copy all HTML files from your app folder to a dist folder.
* The Sass or Less should be converted to a .css file and this should be minified.
* The images should be compressed from the original size to a smaller size by means of the task runner.
* The browser should reload when any file is changed.
